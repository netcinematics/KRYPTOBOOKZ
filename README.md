# KRYPTOBOOKZ
## PURPOSE:

innovative NFTS to be entertaining.

### OVERVIEW
The vision is for NFTs as unique pages of a PICTURE~BOOK.
Where every component is an NFT. Not just the PAGE.
Also the TITLE PAGE as a PROMO. The SNDTRACK.
So we need a STRUCTURE for this, and a CONTRACT.
The BEHAVIOR needs to be:
> COMPOSEABLE, EXTENSIBLE, UPGRADEABLE.

### DESIGN~STRUCTURE
> FRANCHISE, SERIES,
- EPIC: IMG, TXT, SND, VID, TOK
- SERIESID, EPICID, CONTENTID
    > SRZID, EPID, COID.
- Solidity:METANET
    > Map of Maps of Maps.
    > IDT is TIMESTAMP IDs
- IDX-2-IPFS and IPFX to ...
- Web3:METANET
    > Convert IDX 2 IPFS.
    > IPFX is IPFS token Num.

### TODO
- TEST cheaper GAS: Maps or Structs.
- TEST proxy for SERIES extensible []...
- TEST solution for REPLACEABLE [...]
- TEST direct script to blockchain (infura)

### INNOVATIONS
